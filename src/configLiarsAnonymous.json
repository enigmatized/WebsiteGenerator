There are no dues or fees for L.A. membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions. L.A. is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to get honest, stay honest and help others do the same.</p><p>If you are having problems with lying and honesty and think you may be a compulsive liar, you have come to the right place. Liars Anonymous is here to help you. Many of us have come here out of crisis, a crisis that our dishonesty contributed towards. Either our family, personal relationship, work relationships or friendships were in shambles. We came here to get help. You are not alone and there is hope. Welcome.</p>",

  "commonQuestions": "<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details><summary>How do I get started?</summary><p>Begin by attending an online meeting.

Only you can decide.</p></details><details><summary>What happens in a typical meeting?</summary><p>Meetings usually open with brief readings, followed by members sharing their experience, strength, and hope. Sharing is always voluntary—listening is enough. Meetings end with announcements and fellowship.</p></details><details><summary>Is my anonymity protected?</summary><p>We never record meetings, and members agree to keep what is shared confidential. Use only your first name—or a screen-name—if you prefer.</p></details>",
